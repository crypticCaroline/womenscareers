                    Good and bad user experiences don’t just happen by chance; they are the result of either good or bad
                    design!
                    That’s where UX designers come in. They consider each and every element that shapes the user
                    experience—whether
                    it’s for a digital product like an app or website, or for a physical product that you can hold in
                    your hand, like
                    a smartphone. How does it make the user feel? How easy is it to use? Is the user able to complete
                    their desired
                    task without too much thought or effort? UX designers combine market research, product development,
                    strategy,
                    and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services, and processes. They build a
                    bridge to the
                    customer, helping the company or product owner to better understand and fulfill the customer’s needs
                    and
                    expectations.

                <p>Co-founder of Ladies that UX, a global community of women the support and promote each other. This
                    year the group is
                    bringing Talk UX back to Manchester whilst also developing a new and exciting online platform to
                    bring the community
                    to those that can’t make it to a local meet up. Knowing from first-hand experience just how
                    difficult it can be for female
                    UXers to break into a predominantly male sector—and she did something about it. In her own words,
                    “Ladies That UX is all
                    about giving women the chance to support each other, push the UX boundaries, and promote female
                    skill and talent.”
                    She’s currently in talks with Manchester Metropolitan University about how to best deliver a new
                    user experience module for
                    future web development students, and she hopes to play an increasingly active role in the future of
                    UX.
