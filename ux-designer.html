            Good and bad user experiences don’t just happen by chance; they are the result of either good or bad design! 
            That’s where UX designers come in. They consider each and every element that shapes the user experience—whether 
            it’s for a digital product like an app or website, or for a physical product that you can hold in your hand, like
            a smartphone. How does it make the user feel? How easy is it to use? Is the user able to complete their desired 
            task without too much thought or effort? UX designers combine market research, product development, strategy, 
            and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services, and processes. They build a bridge to the 
            customer, helping the company or product owner to better understand and fulfill the customer’s needs and 
            expectations.

          <p>Co-founder of Ladies that UX, a global community of women the support and promote each other. This year the group is 
              bringing Talk UX back to Manchester whilst also developing a new and exciting online platform to bring the community 
              to those that can’t make it to a local meet up. Knowing from first-hand experience just how difficult it can be for female 
              UXers to break into a predominantly male sector—and she did something about it. In her own words, “Ladies That UX is all 
              about giving women the chance to support each other, push the UX boundaries, and promote female skill and talent.”
              She’s currently in talks with Manchester Metropolitan University about how to best deliver a new user experience module for
              future web development students, and she hopes to play an increasingly active role in the future of UX.
