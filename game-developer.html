                <h3>How to become a Games Developer</h3>
                <p> If you are looking to land a game developer job, check out the following steps: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a degree. A bachelor’s degree in software engineering or computer science can 
                        help you stand out to employers. Even if you have plenty of skill and talent, 
                        a certification or completion of a relevant program may demonstrate extensive knowledge 
                        and a solid foundation of the field, and give you a leg up on the equally talented 
                        competition.</li>
                    <li>Understand the process. You should have a full understanding of the game development 
                        process from concept to publishing. Game development requires cooperation with a 
                        number of other departments, so be well-versed in the duties of not just your job, 
                        but the duties of all the other teams you’ll have to work with.</li>
                    <li>Know your computer languages. Behind every video game is the code that is running it. 
                        Programming languages are integral to software development and are responsible for how we 
                        experience and interact with gaming platforms. Well-written code can provide a smooth, 
                        seamless gameplay experience, which is the objective of every game publisher. Game 
                        developers should be familiar with the most popular game engines, have a thorough 
                        knowledge of the C++ programming language, and also a working knowledge of other languages 
                        like C and Java. Rather than pursuing a programming job for a major game development studio 
                        that may require extensive experience, you should try to find your footing in the mobile 
                        game or low-budget indie game world. Knowing a variety of other programming languages and 
                        game engines can expand your skillset and make you a valuable asset to future employers.</li>
                    <li>Perform routine job searches. Some video game companies are more generous with job postings 
                        than others, so periodically checking the job boards from those companies can be beneficial. 
                        You can also create a website or profile on a job site to advertise your skills and availability. 
                        Many smaller game companies can’t afford in-house programmers and will look for freelancers to fill the 
                        developer role, so be sure to aptly market your talents.</li>
                    <li>Build a portfolio. The best way to become a game developer is to develop your own game. If you have 
                        the software (and the time), create a game or prototype that demonstrates your abilities and technical 
                        kills. Compile a portfolio that showcases your best game programming samples.</li>
